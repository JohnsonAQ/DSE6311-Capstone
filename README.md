# Model Development Leveraged To Support At-Risk Intervention in Healthcare: Preventing and Combatting Complications Related to Oxygen Deficiency in Clinical Settings

## Background

Modern healthcare and data-related technological advancement are rapidly evolving areas in today’s society.
As both the healthcare and the technological fields evolve and become more intertwined, healthcare data is being 
leveraged to rapidly identify at-risk patients, and improve decision making by healthcare professionals. Some examples 
of this are machine learning techniques being applied to improve accuracy of heart disease prediction, accurately 
examine breast cancer data, and predict the risk factors linked to heart disease. In a similar manner, we propose
utilizing data science methodologies on anonymized healthcare data, to determine if patient vitals can be used to 
predict and even prevent the furtre need for supplementatry oxygen during a clincal visit by future patients. 
The end goal is to aide healthcare professionals in anticipating and detering complications realted to oxygen deficency,
through planning interventions and implementing preventative measures, and optimizing resource allocation.

## Research Question

Can patient vital signs be used to accurately predict which patients will require supplemental oxygen during hospitalization 
or while receiving other clinical care?

## Hypothesis 

H0: Patient vital signs do not predict whether a patient will require supplemental oxygen.
H1: Patient vital signs can predict whether a patient will require supplemental oxygen.

## Prediction 

Using routinely collected patient vitals, a model can be developed to predict whether a hospitalized 
patient or patient in another clinical setting will require supplemental oxygen (Yes/No). 
In developing such a model, at-risk patients can be identified early, setting the stage for any necessary, 
timely intervention by healthcare providers, and improving patient outcomes.
